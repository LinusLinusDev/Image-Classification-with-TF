# Image Classification with TF
 
This project was created by Linus Palm (https://github.com/LinusLinusDev) as part of the course "Python for Programmers (CS 2520)" at the Cal Poly, Pomona.

This program takes an image of a person as input and then tries to assign the correct gender to that person. To keep this project simple, the model was only trained to classify the images as male or female.

To test the program, simply run the gender_detection.py script and select an image in the window that opens. Make sure that all required libraries are installed

To train and test the model, the first 10020 images of the following dataset were used: http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html
